To fully use the capabilities of this app, you must run both the node.js server and the frontend React App. To run both, simply perform the following steps:
```bash
# install deps:
yarn

# start the server and frontend using:
$ yarn start
```

*currently, this is not deployed but works locally. need to find free hosting in order to deploy.
